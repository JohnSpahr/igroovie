# iGroovie
iGroovie — 4K Text Thrower. Create custom non-animated text for iMovie and other uses; place text onto a 4K canvas and export PNGs.

As you may know, iMovie doesn't have an option to overlay non-animated text. This tool generates a high-res PNG to save and add as an image overlay. 

This was mainly a test of AI code generation in VS Code. Perhaps, it's lame to use AI for these things, but this WAS my original idea. Gotta save time somehow!
